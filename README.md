# Evolutionary-Study
This project investigates the evolutionary relationships among bats, whales, and artiodactyls
Genome sequence of three species of Whales (Physeter catodon, Orcinus orca, Megaptera novaeangliae), Bats (Noctilio Leporinus, Rhinolophus monoceros, Pteropus Alecto) and artinodactyls (Antilocapra americana, Giraffa giraffa, Capreolus capreolus) where taken as query sequence which were compared with eachother and an outgroup(Formica fusca).
Phylogenetic tree were constructed to analyse the evolutionary relationship between these species of intrest.
Key evolutionary events and relationship of the contructed tree where described.
Evolutionary histories were discussed.
Implications in the findings were also been discussed.
